<h1>C.V</h1>

<p>A reliable and adaptable HND Software Development student that offers in depth knowledge of consumer technology, complimented by a sound understanding of designing and programming. I take pride in coding to a high standard and try to regularly refresh my skills to ensure I keep up with ongoing developments. I have overcome considerable personal challenges to get to where I am today, suffering a severe stroke at the age of 15. This has given me a particular drive to achieve each target put in front of me and this is reflected within the workplace. </p>
